# Analisis_Exrtacto_Bancario

This is a analisis of purchases made since 2022 up to february 2023

The main porpouse is to find expenses that are low but at the long time represent high amounts (gasto hormiga)

The source is my bank inform downloaded in serveral failes in pdf format, it didn't allow just one file

The development is made with python code.

In order to not publicate sensitive data I just goint to post the code that read and assemble the PDF files, convert them in csv files join them and then just create a scv file to work with.
