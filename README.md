# Analisis_Exrtacto_Bancario

This is a tool to find that reads PDF back money movments in order to find those small expenses that in daily basis doesn't seem to be high but at the end of the month or a year they really sum a lot.

This is made with python code and in order to not publicate sensitive data I just goint to post the code that read and assemble the PDF pages that you want to analize but the analisys is going to be made with an excel output modified.
